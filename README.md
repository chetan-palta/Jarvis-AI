# Jarvis‑AI 🧠

A Jarvis‑style AI assistant built with Python, featuring voice interaction, task automation, and integrations powered by OpenAI’s GPT‑4.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Voice Recognition** – Use speech-to-text to receive voice commands.  
- **Natural Language Understanding** – Powered by OpenAI API for conversational interactions.  
- **Text-to-Speech Output** – Jarvis responds back with speech.  
- **Task Automation** – Automates your daily tasks (e.g. web search, system tasks, note‑taking).  
- **Modular Design** – Easily extendable modules (e.g. home automation, email, weather).

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**  
- [OpenAI GPT API] for NLU  
- [SpeechRecognition] & [PyAudio] for voice input  
- [pyttsx3] for offline text-to-speech  
- [Flask] (optional) for potential GUI or web interface  
- [Kivy] (optional) for a desktop/mobile UI

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chetan-palta/Jarvis-AI.git
   cd Jarvis-AI
````

2. **Create & activate a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key_here"
   ```

---

## 🎯 Usage

* Run via CLI:

  ```bash
  python jarvis.py
  ```

* Use voice commands like:

  > “Jarvis, what’s the weather in Ludhiana?”
  > “Search Wikipedia for Python programming.”
  > “Set a reminder for 6 pm – meeting with team.”

* \[OPTIONAL] Start the Flask-based web interface:

  ```bash
  python app.py
  ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit `config.json` (if provided) or environment variables to customize:

* Default language/voice settings
* Integration toggles (e.g. enable weather module)
* API credentials

---

## 🧩 Extending Jarvis

1. Create a new module within `modules/tasks`.
2. Add a function like `def run(args): ...`.
3. Register it within `nlu.py` to connect a voice command to this module.
4. You’re done! Jarvis can now execute your custom task.

---

## 🧪 Testing

* Ensure microphone and speakers are connected.
* Run:

  ```bash
  python -m unittest discover tests
  ```
* Add new tests in the `tests/` folder for any added functionality.
